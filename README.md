# Hall Pass Hero

A Papers, Please-inspired game where you play as a school hall monitor checking student hall passes.

## Game Concept

You are a hall monitor in a high school, responsible for ensuring students have valid hall passes before allowing them to walk the halls during class time. You must carefully check each student's hall pass for discrepancies, such as:

- Wrong student name
- Incorrect date
- Suspicious time
- Unauthorized destination
- Missing teacher signature

Make correct decisions to build your reputation as a responsible hall monitor. Make too many mistakes, and you'll lose the trust of the faculty!

## Basic Gameplay

1. Each day, you'll encounter a series of students trying to walk the halls
2. For each student, you can:
   - Inspect their hall pass
   - Approve them to continue
   - Deny them and send them back to class

3. Hall passes may have discrepancies that make them invalid
4. You gain reputation for correct decisions and lose it for incorrect ones
5. Complete each day to progress through the game

## Game Development Status
